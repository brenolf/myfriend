# MyFriend
> A platform to ease dog adoption

There are arguably many homeless dogs on shelters that need homes, but the usually outdated system used in for adoption might not be very effective. MyFriend was a university project (2013) that aimed to ease the process of finding and posting dogs for adoption.

## Live demo
The web site can be accessed [here](http://myfriend-2.herokuapp.com).

## Environment
The project was developed using Django for backend and LESS in front-end.

## Contributions
This project was made with [Rafael Tomazela](https://github.com/sohakes), [Henrique Squinello](https://github.com/hsquinello) and Alexandre Saldanha.

## Support
Even though we have put effort into developing this, we provide no warranty of its complete reliability, i.e. there might be some bugs. You can open an issue if you like to.
